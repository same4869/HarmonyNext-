# HarmonyOS Next efficient architecture practice: Building an asynchronous data processing pipeline based on Cangjie language
In HarmonyOS Next's multi-device collaboration scenario, the device side needs to process a large amount of data from various sensors, input devices and edge data sources in real time and efficiently.The traditional synchronization processing mode not only has high latency, but also easily leads to resource blockage.

本篇以实际项目实践为依据，借助仓颉语言（Cangjie）强大的并发、泛型、函数式特性，设计并实现一个异步数据处理流水线（Pipeline）系统，兼顾性能、扩展性与代码可维护性。

## 1. Architectural design thinking
###Requirement Background
Assuming that an environmental data monitoring system is to be developed on a HarmonyOS Next device to process data flows of multiple sensors (temperature and humidity, air quality, light, etc.), there are the following requirements:
1. **Real-time**: Control data delay at the millisecond level.
2. **High concurrency processing**: Supports processing of data from multiple sensor sources simultaneously.
3. **Modular and clear**: It is convenient to expand new types of data processing functions in the future.
4. **Resource-friendly**: Reasonably control memory and thread usage.

### Overall structure of pipeline
The modules we designed are divided as follows:
[Data source collector] → [Data converter] → [Data memory] → [Exception processing module]

Each module is connected through an asynchronous queue, and the overall data flow is driven by Cangjie's lightweight threads, and a unified data delivery interface is defined with the help of generics.

### Key points of technical selection
|Technical Characteristics | Design Reasons |
|--|--|
|Lightweight user-state threads | Can support a large number of data processing threads without additional burden |
|Concurrent | Ensure safe data transmission in multi-threaded environment |
|Generic interface |Abstract data processing flow, convenient system expansion |
|Lambda expressions and pipeline operators (|>) |Simplify code writing to make data processing logic clearer |
|Algebraic data types (ADT) match pattern | Elegant handling of different sensor data types |

## 2. Core module implementation
### Step 1: Define the interface between the general data unit and pipeline node
```
// Define the data structure
enum SensorData {
    | Temperature(Float64)
    | Humidity(Float64)
    | LightIntensity(Int32)
}

// Pipeline node interface
public interface PipelineStage<I, O> {
    func process(input: I): O
}
```
1. `SensorData` uses ADT to enumerate different data types.
2. `PipelineStage<I, O>` generic interface definition processing logic.

### Step 2: Implement specific pipeline nodes
#### Data Collector
```import runtime.concurrent

public class SensorCollector <: PipelineStage<Unit, SensorData> {
    public override func process(_: Unit): SensorData {
// Simulate randomly generated data
        let random = system.random()
        match(random % 3) {
            case 0 => Temperature(25.0 + random % 10)
            case 1 => Humidity(40.0 + random % 20)
            case _ => LightIntensity((300 + random % 200).toInt())
        }
    }
}
```
1. The input is `Unit`, indicating that no external parameters are needed.
2. The output is a different type of `SensorData`.

#### Data Converter
```
public class DataTransformer <: PipelineStage<SensorData, String> {
    public override func process(input: SensorData): String {
        match(input) {
            case Temperature(v) => "Temp: ${v}°C"
            case Humidity(v) => "Humidity: ${v}%"
            case LightIntensity(v) => "Light: ${v} Lux"
        }
    }
}
```
1. Use the ** pattern matching (match - case) to extract the data and format it.

#### Data storage
```
public class DataStorage <: PipelineStage<String, Unit> {
    public override func process(input: String): Unit {
        println("Storing -> ${input}")
// TODO: It can actually be written to database, cache, network, etc.
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Build an asynchronous pipeline runner
```import runtime.thread

public class PipelineRunner {
    let collector: PipelineStage
    let transformer: PipelineStage
    let storage: PipelineStage

    init(c: PipelineStage, t: PipelineStage, s: PipelineStage) {
        collector = c
        transformer = t
        storage = s
    }

    public func start(): Unit {
        thread.start {
            while (true) {
                let rawData = collector.process(())
                let formatted = transformer.process(rawData)
                storage.process(formatted)
                sleep(500 * Duration.Millisecond)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
1. Each pipeline is driven by a single lightweight thread, continuously pulling data and processing it.
2. Flexible combination of components at different stages through generic parameters.

### Step 4: Finally start the pipeline
```
main() {
    let pipeline = PipelineRunner(
        SensorCollector(),
        DataTransformer(),
        DataStorage()
    )
    pipeline.start()

// Simulate the main thread to keep running
    while(true) {
        sleep(5 * Duration.Second)
    }
}
```

## 3. Performance optimization and scaling
### Concurrency and Resource Control
1. Multiple pipeline instances can be started to process different sensor groups separately to achieve reasonable resource scheduling.
2. Use lock-free concurrent queues instead of direct processing to further optimize system throughput:
```import runtime.concurrent

let queue = concurrent.Queue()

thread.start {
    while (true) {
        let data = SensorCollector().process(())
        queue.enqueue(data)
        sleep(100 * Duration.Millisecond)
    }
}

thread.start {
    while (true) {
        let item = queue.dequeue()
        if (item != null) {
            let formatted = DataTransformer().process(item!!)
            DataStorage().process(formatted)
        }
    }
}
```

### Future expansion direction
|Extension Points | Design Thinking |
|--|--|
|Support dynamic addition of pipeline stage | Dynamic registration of new processors using generic + factory mode |
|Support asynchronous exception handling mechanism |Encapsulate `try-catch` in `PipelineRunner` and callback error handler |
|Flow control and load balancing support | Monitor queue length, dynamically adjust production/consumption rate based on traffic |

## Summary
Through this case, we can see that Cangjie language is very suitable for building a highly concurrent and highly scalable asynchronous processing system:
1. Lightweight threading model makes high concurrency processing easy.
2. Generics and pattern matching make modularity and extension simple and natural.
3. Runtime optimization and concurrent object mechanism take into account performance and security.

In the development of HarmonyOS Next, this mode can be applied to the following scenarios:
1. Sensor data monitoring system.
2. Real-time log collection and processing system.
3. Streaming media processing system.
4. Edge intelligent data preprocessing module.

With the continuous improvement of Cangjie Language and HarmonyOS Next ecosystem, this modular + asynchronous concurrent pipeline design model will become the standard choice for more and more high-performance application development.
