# HarmonyOS Next Performance Tuning: Full Analysis of Visual Concurrency Analysis Tool
In the development practice of HarmonyOS Next, performance optimization is a key link in creating high-quality applications.Faced with the complex performance problems in concurrent programming, the visual concurrency analysis tool provided by Cangjie Language has become a good assistant for developers.As a technician who has long used this tool to optimize performance, I will explain the architectural design, usage methods and collaborative optimization strategies with ArkTS in detail based on actual cases.

## 1. Tool architecture design
### (I) The principle of data acquisition of swim lane diagram (Tasks/Measure)
The core of the visual concurrency analysis tool is the Tasks lane and the Measure lane, and their data acquisition principles are the basis for understanding and using the tool.

Measure lanes are mainly responsible for collecting task statistics in different concurrency modes.It monitors and counts the various states of the task (such as running, waiting, completing, etc.) in real time when the system is running.For example, in a multithreaded network request task, the Measure lane can accurately count the number of network request tasks running at a certain moment.The implementation principle is to insert data acquisition codes at key nodes such as task start, pause, recovery and end. These codes record the status information of the task into a specific data structure. The Measure lane displays the change trend and quantity statistics of the task status based on these data.

Tasks lanes focus on collecting the operation of a single task, including the life cycle information of the task.It records the status and execution time of the task at different points in time by tracking various stages such as task creation, scheduling, execution and ending.For example, for a complex computing task, the Tasks lane can show the time consumption of the task from the start of execution to the completion of the various sub-stages it has gone through, helping developers to gain insight into the execution process of the task.The data acquisition of Tasks lanes depends on the hook functions provided by the task management system. When a key lifecycle event of a task occurs, these hook functions are called to record relevant information.

## 2. Practical tuning cases
### (I) Steps for positioning parallel failure problem (with screenshot notes)
In actual development, parallel failure is one of the common performance problems, manifested as tasks seem to be executed in parallel, but in fact they do not make full use of system resources, resulting in less obvious performance improvements.The following is an image rendering application as an example to introduce the steps to use the visual concurrency analysis tool to locate parallel failure problems.

1. **Run the application and enable the tool**: Start the image rendering application, and open the visual concurrency analysis tool to start collecting data.
2. **Observe Measure lane**: In the Measure lane, select the concurrency mode related to the image rendering task.As can be seen from Figure 1 (assuming here that Figure 1 is a screenshot of the Measure lane) that during image rendering, the number of Running Tasks is much lower than expected parallelism, indicating that there may be a parallel failure problem.
3. **View Tasks lane**: Switch to Tasks lane to view the execution of specific tasks.From Figure 2 (assuming that Figure 2 is a screenshot of the Tasks lane), it was found that some image rendering tasks were in a waiting state for a long time. Further analysis found that due to resource competition between tasks, some key resources (such as specific functional modules of the graphics processing unit) were used serially, resulting in blockage of parallel execution.
4. **Positioning root cause**: According to the information of Tasks lane, in-depth code to check resource allocation and scheduling logic.The final discovery is that in the image rendering algorithm, there is no reasonable concurrent control over the access of shared resources, resulting in the inability to truly execute the tasks in parallel.
5. **Optimization and verification**: Modify the code, adopt more reasonable resource allocation and concurrency control strategies, rerun the application and use tools for monitoring.After optimization, the number of Running Tasks in the Measure lane has reached expectations, the task waiting time in the Tasks lane has been greatly reduced, and the image rendering performance has been significantly improved.

## 3. Collaborative optimization with ArkTS
### (I) Performance monitoring strategies during hybrid programming
In HarmonyOS Next development, hybrid programming of Cangjie language and ArkTS is often involved.In this case, performance monitoring requires special strategies to ensure performance optimization throughout the application.

First, in terms of tool configuration, it is necessary to ensure that the visual concurrency analysis tool can monitor the execution of tasks in Cangjie language and ArkTS code at the same time.This usually requires specifying monitoring rules for different language codes in the project configuration, allowing the tool to correctly identify and collect task data.

Secondly, focus on task interactions across language boundaries for possible cross-language call performance problems in hybrid programming.For example, when the Actor in Cangjie language sends a message to an interface component written by ArkTS, it monitors the delay and frequency of message delivery.If you find that the message delivery has a high delay, check the interface implementation and data transmission methods of cross-language calls, optimize the data serialization and deserialization process, reduce the data transmission amount, and improve the message delivery efficiency.

Finally, during performance analysis, the execution of Cangjie language and ArkTS code is comprehensively considered.Find out the performance bottleneck by comparing the resource usage and task execution time of different language modules during concurrent execution.For example, if you find that the ArkTS interface rendering thread is stuttered due to waiting for the Cangjie language calculation task results, you can optimize the execution order of the calculation task or increase the cache mechanism, reduce the waiting time of the interface thread, and improve the overall performance of the application.

Visual concurrency analysis tools are critical for performance tuning in HarmonyOS Next development.By deeply understanding its architecture design, proficient in using its problem-oriented functions, and mastering collaborative optimization strategies with ArkTS, developers can improve application performance more efficiently and bring users a smoother user experience.In actual development, this tool should be fully utilized, continuously optimized code, and promoted the development of the HarmonyOS Next application ecosystem.
