# HarmonyOS Next program structure design: global and local scope control
In the development process of Cangjie language at HarmonyOS Next, the design of program structure is the key to building stable and efficient applications, and the rational control of global and local scope is one of the core points of program structure design.As a technician with rich practical experience in this field, I will discuss this important knowledge point in depth based on my experience in actual projects.

## 1. Scope hierarchy rules
### (I) Nested scope variable coverage experiment (with memory diagram)
In Cangjie language, the hierarchical rules of scope determine the visibility and life cycle of variables.Scopes are defined by braces "{}" and can be nested between different scopes.When the variable defined in the inner scope is the same as the variable in the outer scope, variable overwriting will occur.This phenomenon can be clearly seen through a simple experiment:
```cj
main() {
    let num = 10;
println("outer scope num: \(num)");
    {
        let num = 20;
println("Inner scope num: \(num)");
    }
println("Back to outer scope num: \(num)");
}
```
Run the above code and the output is:
```
Outer scope num: 10
Inner scope num: 20
Back to outer scope num: 10
```
From the results, we can see that the `num` variable defined in the inner scope covers the `num` variable of the outer scope, but this coverage is only valid in the inner scope. After leaving the inner scope, the `num` variable of the outer scope still maintains its original value.

From a memory point of view, the storage location of variables in memory is closely related to the scope.When a program executes to a scope, memory space is allocated for variables defined in that scope.In nested scopes, variables in the inner scope are in different positions in memory from variables with the same name in the outer scope. They are independent of each other and do not affect each other (except for access differences caused by overwriting).It can be represented by the following simple memory diagram:
|Memory area|Variable|
|---|---|
|External scope memory area|num (value 10)|
|Inner scope memory area|num (value is 20)|

Understanding this mechanism is crucial to avoid variable naming conflicts and ensure that the program logic is correct.In actual development, especially in large projects, different modules may use the same variable name. The rational use of scope hierarchy rules can effectively manage these variables and improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

## 2. Variable life cycle
### (I) Source code analysis required for initialization of global variables
In Cangjie language, global variables must be initialized when defined, which has clear regulations at the source code level.For example:
```cj
// Error example, global variable not initialized
let globalVar: Int64; 
```
The above code will cause a compilation error, prompting that the global variable needs to be initialized.This is because global variables are loaded into memory when the program starts, and if not initialized, their value is uncertain, which may lead to unpredictable results during the program run.

From the source code implementation point of view, the compiler checks whether the initial value is provided when processing global variable definitions.If not, the compiler will throw an error message, preventing the program from continuing to compile.This design ensures that global variables always have a definite value before use, improving the stability and reliability of the program.

In actual development, when defining global variables, we should strictly initialize them in accordance with the requirements to avoid potential problems caused by uninitialization.For example, in a multi-module collaboration project, if a global variable is used to store system configuration information, the uninitialized variable may cause problems in collaboration between modules, affecting the normal operation of the entire system.

## 3. Cross-file reference design
### (I) Practice of public modifiers in modular development
In modular development, referring variables and functions across files is a common requirement.Cangjie Language uses the `public` modifier to control the visibility of variables and functions and realizes cross-file references.For example, a common function is defined in a file named `module1.cj`:
```cj
// module1.cj
public func sharedFunction() {
println("This is a public function");
}
```
In another file `main.cj`, this public function can be called by importing the module:
```cj
// main.cj
import module1

main() {
    sharedFunction();
}
```
In the above example, the `public` modifier makes the `sharedFunction` function visible and callable in other files.This is very practical in actual projects. For example, in a large application, some common tool functions or shared data are defined in a module and the `public` modifier is used, so that other modules can easily refer to and use these functions, improving the reusability of the code and the collaboration between modules.

At the same time, the rational use of the `public` modifier also helps control the boundaries and access rights of the module.Setting only necessary variables and functions to `public` can avoid excessive access to internal implementation details by other modules, enhancing code security and maintainability.In actual development, we should carefully select which elements need to be set to `public` according to the functions and needs of the module to ensure the independence and stability of the module.

Mastering relevant knowledge of global and local scope is crucial to designing a reasonable program structure, optimizing code performance, and improving development efficiency.In the actual development process, developers should fully understand and reasonably use these rules to ensure the correctness and maintainability of the program.
