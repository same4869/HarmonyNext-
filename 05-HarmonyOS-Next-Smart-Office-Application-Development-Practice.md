In the wave of digital office, smart office applications have become a key tool to improve work efficiency.Today, we will start a journey of developing smart office applications with the help of HarmonyOS Next and Cangjie language to see how to make office more efficient and convenient.

## Functional Planning and Technical Architecture
### Disassembly of the functional module of intelligent office application
Smart office applications are designed to meet the diverse needs of modern offices in one stop.First of all, the document editing function. To realize basic word processing and formatting, it is best to support real-time collaborative editing for multiple people, just as convenient as everyone writes on the same sheet of paper at the same time.Schedule management functions are also indispensable, allowing users to easily arrange meetings and set task reminders, and can also intelligently recommend appropriate schedules based on user habits.In addition, the instant messaging function can facilitate communication among team members, while the file sharing function can allow data to flow quickly within the team.

### Technical architecture selection and Cangjie language advantages
Faced with a variety of technical solutions, we chose HarmonyOS Next and Cangjie language to build intelligent office applications.HarmonyOS Next's distributed soft bus technology is like an information highway, which allows data to be quickly and stably transmitted between different devices, achieving seamless collaborative office work between devices.Cangjie's language grammar is concise and intuitive, with high development efficiency, and its rich libraries and tools can help us quickly realize complex functions.Moreover, Cangjie Language excels in concurrent programming and cross-language interaction, which is crucial for smart office applications that need to handle a large number of concurrent tasks and integrate multiple third-party services.

## Core Function Development
### Document editing function implementation
When developing document editing functions, using the custom construction functions of Cangjie language, we can easily integrate external document processing libraries.For example, introduce an open source rich text editing library and add it to the project dependency through cjpm.During the build process, the library is initialized and configured using custom pre-tasks to ensure it blends perfectly with our applications.

```cj
func stagePreBuild(): Int64 {
// Execute external library initialization command
    exec("cd {workspace}/document-lib && npm install && npm run build");
    return 0;
}
```

In actual document editing code, we use the object-oriented characteristics of Cangjie language to encapsulate the relevant logic of document operations.For example, create a `Document` class that contains attributes and methods such as text content, formatting, etc., to facilitate unified management and operation of documents.

### Smart reminder in the schedule management module
We use Agent DSL to implement the intelligent reminder function of the schedule management module.Define a `ScheduleAgent`, which can intelligently judge the reminder time based on the schedule set by the user, combined with the user's location, busy status and other information.

```cj
agent ScheduleAgent {
@prompt[pattern=intelligent reminder] (
action: "Send reminder messages according to schedule",
purpose: "Make sure users don't miss important meetings and tasks",
expectation: "Remind users in the right way at the right time"
    )

    func sendReminder(schedule: Schedule) {
// Determine the user's current status and location
        let isBusy = checkUserBusyStatus();
        let location = getCurrentLocation();
        if (!isBusy && isNearOffice(location)) {
// Send reminder messages, which can integrate SMS, in-app notifications and other methods
            sendNotification(schedule.title, schedule.content);
        }
    }
}
```

In this way, when an important schedule is approaching, the application can promptly remind users to avoid missing important matters.

## Application debugging and optimization
### Visualize parallel concurrent tuning
In smart office applications, it is normal to handle multiple tasks at the same time, such as document saving, message sending and schedule updates at the same time.At this time, the visual parallel concurrency tuning tool comes in handy.Through this tool, we can intuitively see the execution of each task, including the task start time, execution time, waiting time, etc.

If you find that a task is executed slowly, such as the document is stored for too long, we can view the task scheduling information and analyze whether there are any problems such as resource competition or thread blockage.For example, multiple tasks may access the file system simultaneously, resulting in too long wait time for file storage operations.At this time, we can optimize the task scheduling strategy, adopt the queuing mechanism or increase the file system's read and write buffers to improve the system's concurrency performance.

### AI empowerment in IDE improves development efficiency
During the development process, making full use of the AI ​​empowerment functions in the IDE can greatly improve development efficiency.The code generation function can help us quickly write repetitive code. For example, when creating relevant code for agenda reminder, AI can automatically complete the code framework by just entering a few keywords.

知识问答功能就像一个随时在线的技术专家，当我们遇到问题，比如如何实现多人实时协作编辑文档时，在IDE中直接提问，AI就能给出相关的代码示例和技术方案，让我们少走很多弯路。Through these AI empowerment functions, we can focus more on the implementation of core business logic and accelerate the application development process.

Through the above development process, we have successfully created an intelligent office application with multiple practical functions.I hope that when developing similar applications, you can get inspiration from these experiences, constantly explore more potentials of HarmonyOS Next and Cangjie languages, and contribute more innovative applications to the field of smart offices!
