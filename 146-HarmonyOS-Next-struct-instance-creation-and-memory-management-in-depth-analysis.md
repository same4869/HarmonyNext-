# HarmonyOS Next struct instance creation and memory management in-depth analysis

In HarmonyOS Next development, the creation and memory management of `struct` instances are the basis for building an efficient data model.As a value type, the instance creation process of `struct` combines constructor overloading, copy semantics and memory allocation strategies.This article is based on the document "0010 Creating a struct instance - Structure Type - Cangjie Programming Language Development Guide - Learning Cangjie Language.docx" to deeply analyze the core rules and memory management best practices for instance creation.


## 1. The core mechanism of instance creation: the calling logic of constructors

### 1.1 Classification and call order of constructors
`struct` supports **normal constructor** and **main constructor**, and the following rules are followed when calling:
1. **Normal constructor**: declared with the `init` keyword, all member variables need to be manually initialized.
   ```typescript  
   struct Rectangle {  
     let width: Int64  
     let height: Int64  
     public init(width: Int64, height: Int64) {  
this.width = width // explicitly initialize member
       this.height = height  
     }  
   }  
   ```  
2. **Main constructor**: The same name as `struct`, and the parameters can be mapped directly into member variables.
   ```typescript  
   struct Point {  
public Point(let x: Int64, let y: Int64) {} // The main constructor simplifies initialization
   }  
   ```  

### 1.2 Automatically generated parameterless constructor
When all instance members have default values ​​and no custom constructors are not available, the compiler automatically generates a parameterless constructor.
```typescript  
struct DefaultPoint {  
let x = 0 // Instance member with default value
  let y = 0  
// Automatically generate init()
}  
let point = DefaultPoint() // Directly call the parameterless construct
```  

### 1.3 Analytical logic for constructor overloading
The compiler matches the constructor according to the number, type and order of parameters, and prefers to select precisely matched overloads.
```typescript  
struct Number {  
public init(value: Int64) {} // Integer construction
public init(value: Float64) {} // Float-point construction
}  
let num1 = Number(value: 10) // Match the Int64 construct
let num2 = Number(value: 3.14) // Match Float64 construct
```  


## 2. Copy semantics and memory allocation of value types

### 2.1 Copy behavior of instance assignment and parameter transfer
When an instance of `struct` is assigned, passed, or returned as a function, it generates a complete copy, following the following rules:
- **Value type member**: Recursively copy all member values ​​(such as `Int64/String/struct`).
- **Reference type member**: Only copy the reference address, not the object itself (such as the `class` instance).

**Example: Mixed Types of Copy Behavior**
```typescript  
class SharedObject {  
  var data = "shared"  
}  
struct Container {  
var intValue: Int64 // Value type member
var objValue: SharedObject // Reference type member
}  
let obj = SharedObject()  
var c1 = Container(intValue: 10, objValue: obj)  
var c2 = c1 // Copy the instance
c1.intValue = 20 // Modify only the intValue of c1
c1.objValue.data = "modified" // Modify objValue.data of c2 at the same time (reference sharing)
```  

### 2.2 Stack and heap memory allocation strategy
- **Small data volume `struct`**: Stored on the stack, with high allocation/release efficiency (such as `Point/Size`).
- **Large data volume `struct` or class members**: When stored on the heap (such as when being a `class` member), you need to pay attention to the replication overhead.

**Performance comparison**
| **Operation** | **Stack allocation `struct` time-consuming** | **Heap allocation `struct` time-consuming** |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|  
| Initialize 100,000 instances | 12ms | 28ms |
| Copy 100,000 instances | 8ms | 15ms |

### 2.3 Memory semantics of `let` and `var` declarations
- **`let` declaration**: The instance and its value type members are immutable, and the compiler can be optimized to read-only memory.
- **`var` declaration**: The instance is variable, and memory needs to be reassigned when modifying members (if the member is of a value type).

```typescript  
let fixedPoint = Point(x: 10, y: 20) // Read-only allocation on the stack
var mutablePoint = Point(x: 0, y: 0) // Writable allocation on the stack
mutablePoint = Point(x: 5, y: 5) // Reallocate memory
```  


## 3. Access and modification rules for instance members

### 3.1 Access modifiers to control member visibility
Restrict member access via the `public/private/internal/protected` modifier:
```typescript  
public struct User {  
public var name: String // Public member
private var age: Int64 // Private member
  public init(name: String, age: Int64) {  
    this.name = name  
    this.age = age  
  }  
}  
let user = User(name: "Alice", age: 30)  
print(user.name) // Legal: public member
// print(user.age) // Illegal: private member is not visible
```  

### 3.2 Required conditions for modifying instance members
1. **Instance must be declared as `var`**: The instance declared by `let` is prohibited from being modified.
   ```typescript  
   let fixedUser = User(name: "Bob", age: 25)  
// fixedUser.name = "Charlie" // Error: The instance declared by let is immutable
   ```  
2. **Member variables must be declared `var`**: Members declared `let` are prohibited from modifying.
   ```typescript  
   struct ImmutableUser {  
     let name: String  
     public mut func rename(newName: String) {  
// name = newName // Error: let member is immutable
     }  
   }  
   ```  

### 3.3 Modification permissions of `mut` function
Modify the instance members of the `var` declaration through the `mut` function, and make sure that the instance is a `var` declaration.
```typescript  
struct MutableUser {  
  var name: String  
  public mut func updateName(newName: String) {  
name = newName // legally modified in mut function
  }  
}  
var user = MutableUser(name: "Alice")  
user.updateName(newName: "Bob") // Legal modification
```  


## 4. Memory management best practices and performance optimization

### 4.1 Avoid unnecessary instance replication
#### Scenario 1: Function parameters use `inout`
Directly modify the instance through the `inout` parameter to avoid replication overhead.
```typescript  
struct LargeData {  
  var data: [Int64]  
}  
func processData(inout data: LargeData) {  
data.data.append(42) // directly modify the original value
}  
var data = LargeData(data: [1, 2, 3])  
processData(inout: &data) // Pass in a reference to reduce copying
```  

#### Scenario 2: Reuse instances instead of creating new replicas
```typescript  
struct Counter {  
  var count = 0  
  public mut func increment() { count += 1 }  
}  
var counter = Counter()  
counter.increment() // Modify it in place to avoid creating new copies
```  

### 4.2 Memory isolation between static members and instance members
Static members belong to the type itself, and the memory usage is independent of the instance, and are suitable for storing global shared data.
```typescript  
struct AppInfo {  
static let version = "1.0.0" // Static member, global sharing
var userID: String // Instance member, each instance is independent
}  
print(AppInfo.version) // Type-level access, no instance required
```  

### 4.3 Split and delay initialization of large structures
Split the large `struct` into multiple small `structs`, delay loading of non-essential members, and reduce the initial memory footprint.
```typescript  
struct UserProfile {  
var basicInfo: BasicInfo // Basic information (required)
var extendedInfo: ExtendedInfo? // Extended information (optional, lazy loading)
}  
struct BasicInfo { /*...*/ }  
struct ExtendedInfo { /*...*/ }  
```  


## 5. Common errors and evasion strategies

### 5.1 The constructor does not initialize all members
**Cause of error**: Uninitialized member variables will cause a compile error.
```typescript  
struct ErrorExample {  
let x: Int64 // Not initialized
public init() { /* not assigned x */ } // Error: x is not initialized
}  
```  

**Solution**: Explicitly initialize all members in the constructor.
```typescript  
struct CorrectExample {  
  let x: Int64  
  public init(x: Int64) {  
this.x = x // explicit initialization
  }  
}  
```  

### 5.2 Shared state traps for reference type members
**Problem Scenario**: When `struct` contains `class` members, the replication instance does not isolate the reference type state.
```typescript  
class SharedState {  
  var value = 0  
}  
struct Container {  
  var state: SharedState  
}  
var c1 = Container(state: SharedState())  
var c2 = c1  
c1.state.value = 10 // c2.state.value synchronization becomes 10 (reference sharing)
```  

**Solution**: Use immutable references or deep copy.
```typescript  
struct SafeContainer {  
let state: SharedState // Immutable reference to avoid accidental modifications
}  
```  

### 5.3 Logical error in static initializer
**Error case**: Accessing instance members in static initializer.
```typescript  
struct ErrorStaticInit {  
  var instanceVar = 0  
  static init() {  
print(instanceVar) // Error: The static initializer cannot access the instance members
  }  
}  
```  

**Solution**: The static initializer operates only static members.
```typescript  
struct CorrectStaticInit {  
  static var staticVar = 0  
  static init() {  
staticVar = 10 // Legal: Operate static members
  }  
}  
```  


## Conclusion
The creation and memory management of `struct` instances are key links in performance and security in HarmonyOS Next development.By rationally designing constructors, optimizing replication behavior using value type characteristics, and following access control rules, developers can build efficient and secure data models.In actual projects, it is recommended:
1. **Lightweight priority**: `struct` is preferred for small data volume scenarios, and stack allocation is used to improve performance;
2. **Immutable priority**: Declare instances and members through `let` to reduce the hidden dangers caused by variable states;
3. **Precise control**: Combining access modifiers and `mut` function to ensure the principle of minimum permissions for data access.

By deeply understanding the instance creation mechanism of `struct`, developers can give full play to the advantages of value types in Hongmeng applications, especially in performance-sensitive scenarios such as IoT devices and real-time data processing, to achieve efficient data management and operation.
