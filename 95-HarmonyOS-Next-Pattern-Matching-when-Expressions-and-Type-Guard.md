# HarmonyOS Next Pattern Matching: when Expressions and Type Guard
In HarmonyOS Next development, pattern matching is a powerful feature that allows code to execute different logic based on different conditions, in which `when` expressions and type guards play a key role.As a technical expert with rich experience in related technical fields, I will explore their usage methods, characteristics and performance optimization principles below.

## Chapter 1: Basic Matching
The `when` expression is used to pattern match values, which is especially convenient when dealing with enum types.Suppose we have an enum that represents different graph types:
```cj
enum ShapeType {
    case circle
    case rectangle
    case triangle
}
```
The `when` expression can be easily deconstructed and perform corresponding operations:
```cj
let shape: ShapeType =.ShapeType.circle
when (shape) {
    case.ShapeType.circle:
println("This is a circle")
    case.ShapeType.rectangle:
println("This is a rectangle")
    case.ShapeType.triangle:
println("This is a triangle")
    default:
println("Unknown Graphic Type")
}
```
In addition, the `when` expression also supports the use of wildcard `_` to match arbitrary values.For example, when dealing with an array that may contain elements of different types:
```cj
let mixedArray: Array<Any> = [1, "string", 3.14]
for (element in mixedArray) {
    when (element) {
        is Int:
println("This is an integer: \(element as! Int)")
        is String:
println("This is a string: \(element as! String)")
        _:
println("This is another type of element")
    }
}
```
The wildcard `_` is used here to match all types except Int and String, making the code more universal.

## Chapter 2: Intelligent Conversion
Type guard is an important concept in pattern matching. It can check the type of value at runtime and perform intelligent conversions.After the compiler encounters an `is` check, it narrows the type of the variable.For example:
```cj
func printLength(value: Any) {
    if value is String {
        let str = value as! String
println("String length is: \(str.length)")
    }
}
```
In this example, through the type guard check of `value is String`, the compiler can determine that `value` is of type `String` within the `if` code block, so that casting can be safely performed.This intelligent transformation mechanism avoids unnecessary runtime errors and improves code reliability.

`when` expression combined with type guard can achieve more complex logic.For example, dealing with a variable that may be an integer or a floating point number:
```cj
let number: Any = 3.14
when (number) {
    is Int:
        let intValue = number as! Int
println("Integer: \(intValue)")
    is Float:
        let floatValue = number as! Float
println("FloatValue: \(floatValue)")
}
```
Such a code structure is clear and can perform different operations according to the actual type of the variable.

## Chapter 3: Performance Optimization
When the compiler processes the `when` expression, it will generate a Jump Table according to different situations to optimize performance.A jump table is a data structure that can jump directly to the corresponding code block based on the matching value, without making conditional judgments one by one.

For example, when processing `when` expressions containing a large number of enum values:
```cj
enum Fruit {
    case apple
    case banana
    case cherry
// More enum values...
    case orange
}
let myFruit: Fruit =.banana
when (myFruit) {
    case.apple:
println("This is Apple")
    case.banana:
println("This is a banana")
// More branches...
    case.orange:
println("This is an orange")
}
```
The compiler will generate a jump table based on the number and distribution of enum values.If the enumeration value is a continuous integer, the jump table can quickly locate the corresponding code block through simple index calculation, greatly improving the matching efficiency.This optimization mechanism allows `when` expression to maintain efficient execution speed when processing complex matching logic.

Mastering the skills of using `when` expressions and type guards, and understanding the performance optimization principles of compilers can help developers write more concise, efficient and reliable code in HarmonyOS Next development.Whether it is handling enumeration types, performing type checking, or optimizing complex matching logic, pattern matching provides us with powerful tools.
