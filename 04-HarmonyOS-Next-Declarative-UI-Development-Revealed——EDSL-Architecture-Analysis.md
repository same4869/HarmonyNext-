When developing HarmonyOS Next's distributed desktop system, our team increased the development efficiency of complex interfaces by 3 times through Cangjie's declarative UI framework.This eDSL-based UI solution not only makes the code more concise, but also shows amazing advantages in cross-device rendering.Below I will reveal its core design principles.

## 1. UI eDSL design philosophy

### 1.1 Layout Magic that Follows Lambda
```cangjie
Column {
    Text("Hello Harmony")
        .fontSize(24.vp)
        .margin(top: 10.vp)
    
    Button("Submit") {
// Click event processing
    }
    .width(80.percent)
}
```
**Compilation and conversion process**:
1. `Column{}` is expanded as `Column.build { ... }`
2. Convert chain calls to property setting method
3. The percentage unit is converted to specific pixel values ​​during the compilation period

Advantages compared with traditional imperative UI:

| Indicators | Imperative Code | eDSL Code | Advantages |
|---------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Number of lines of code | 120 | 45 | 62% reduction |
| Readability Rating | 6.2/10 | 9.1/10 | 47% Improvement |
| Type Safety | Partial | Complete | Compile Period Verification |

### 1.2 Principles of component tree construction
The compiler processes UI DSL through the following steps:
```mermaid
graph TD
A[parse code] --> B[macro expansion]
B --> C[Type Check]
C --> D[Generate Component Tree IR]
D --> E[Optimized layout calculation]
```
In a distributed scenario, the IR tree can be serialized to other devices and re-rendered.

## 2. Core mechanism of state management

### 2.1 @State Macro's Compilation Period Magic
```cangjie
@State var counter: Int = 0

// The equivalent code after the macro is expanded
private var __counter = StateStorage(0)
var counter: Int {
    get { __counter.value }
    set {
        __counter.value = newValue
        __counter.notifyDependents()
    }
}
```
**Responsive update process**:
1. Automatically register dependencies when component reads status
2. Mark dirty components when status changes
3. Only dirty components are updated in the next frame

### 2.2 Cross-device status synchronization
```cangjie
@DistributedState 
var sharedConfig: Config
```
Through Hongmeng’s distributed data bus:
- Status changes are automatically synchronized to all devices
- Conflict Resolution Policy Configurable (LWW/CRDT)
- Tested synchronization delay <8ms (same LAN)

## 3. Performance optimization strategy

### 3.1 Differential refresh algorithm
Optimization strategies when component updates:
```cangjie
func shouldUpdate(old: Props, new: Props) -> Bool {
// Compare only key attributes
    return old.key != new.key 
        || old.style != new.style
        || old.children != new.children
}
```
In the file manager application of ten thousand-level nodes:
- Full refresh: 12ms/frame
- Differential refresh: 2.3ms/frame

### 3.2 Compilation period layout optimization
Special optimizations achieved through macros:
```cangjie
@StaticLayout 
Column {
// Compile period to calculate fixed layout
    Text("Static Content")
    Image(res: "fixed.png")
}
```
Optimization effect:
- Skip runtime layout calculations
- Memory usage reduction by 40%
- First frame rendering speed is increased by 3 times

---

**Practical Lesson**: When developing distributed whiteboard functions, the initial failure to use `@StaticLayout` resulted in cross-device synchronization lag.Finally, the hybrid strategy of "dynamic component differential update + static component precompilation" was adopted to achieve a 60FPS collaborative drawing experience on the Mate 60 series.
