# HarmonyOS cross-language programming practice: interoperability optimization between C and JS

> As a developer who has stepped on hybrid programming memory pit, the on-board system crashed due to improper C pointer management.This article combines practical experience to share the core skills of C and JS interoperability in HarmonyOS, including secure encapsulation, asynchronous processing and performance optimization, to help you avoid common pitfalls.


## 1. C pointer security encapsulation practice

### 1. Memory management of string transfer
C language string processing functions hide memory traps and must strictly manage pointer life cycles:

```c
// C function: string inversion (the caller needs to release memory)
char* reverse_str(char* str) {
    if (!str) return NULL;
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    char* result = (char*)malloc(len + 1);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        result[i] = str[len - i - 1];
    }
    result[len] = '\0';
    return result;
}
```  

```cj
// Cangjie safe packaging (the key is defer release)
import "C"

func safe_reverse(str: String) -> String {
    let c_str = str.cString(using: .utf8)
defer { free(c_str) } // Automatically release the input pointer
    
    guard let rev_cstr = C.reverse_str(c_str) else {
        return ""
    }
defer { free(rev_cstr) } // Release return pointer
    
    return String(cString: rev_cstr, encoding: .utf8) ?? ""
}
```  

**Core Tips**:
- All C pointer operations must be released with `defer`
- Use `guard` to handle NULL pointer situation in advance


## 2. Promise transformation of JS asynchronous operation

### 1. Callback to the Terminator of Hell
Traditional JS callbacks are easily out of control in complex logic, and Promise is a better choice:

```javascript
// JS asynchronous function (callback method)
function fetch_data(url, success, fail) {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onload = () => success(xhr.response);
xhr.onerror = () => fail(new Error("Load failed"));
    xhr.open("GET", url);
    xhr.send();
}
```  

```cj
// Convert to Promise (Cangjie Language)
import js_engine

func fetch_promise(url: String) -> Promise<String> {
    return Promise { resolve, reject in
        js_engine.call_func("fetch_data", [
            url,
// Successfully callback to resolve
            {(data: String) -> Void in resolve(data)},
// Failed callback to reject
            {(error: Error) -> Void in reject(error)}
        ])
    }
}

//How to use
fetch_promise("https://api.data.com")
    .then { data in process_data(data) }
    .catch { err in log_error(err) }
```  

**Advantage comparison**:
| Method | Code Complexity | Error Handling | Chain Calls |
|------------|------------|----------|----------|  
| Callback Function | High | Dispersion | Difficult |
| Promise | Low | Centralized | Support |


## 3. Performance optimization of type conversion

### 1. Actual test of the overhead of cross-language conversion
Frequent type conversion will bring significant performance losses, and the actual measured data is as follows:

```cj
import time

func test_conversion() {
    let start = time.now()
    for _ in 0..100000 {
// Cangjie → JS → Cangjie's type round-trip
        let js_num = js_engine.to_js(42)
        let cj_num = js_engine.to_cj(js_num) as! Int
    }
    let cost = time.now() - start
print($"100,000 conversion time: {cost}ms") // Typical output: about 85ms
}
```  

### 2. Optimization strategy
1. **Batch Conversion**: Merge multiple small conversions into single large conversions
2. **Cached results**: Only convert frequently used data once
3. **Avoid nesting**: Reduce multi-layer `to_js`/`to_cj` calls

```cj
// Optimization example: batch processing array
func process_js_array(arr: [Int]) {
// Convert the entire array at once
    let js_arr = js_engine.to_js(arr)
// Batch processing...
    js_engine.call_func("process_batch", [js_arr])
// Only convert the result once
    let result = js_engine.to_cj(js_engine.call_func("get_result")) as! [String]
}
```  


## 4. Guide to avoid pits in practice

1. **C pointer trap**:
- Never use wild pointers, all `malloc` must correspond to `free`
- Use `defer` to ensure resource release in exceptional situations

2. **JS engine memory**:
- Long-running JS objects need to manually call `js_engine.release()`
- Avoid creating temporary JS functions in loops

3. **Async processing**:
- Promise chain must contain `catch` to prevent unhandled exceptions
- Timeout operation adds `finally` to release resources


## Conclusion
Hybrid programming of C and JS is an important capability of the HarmonyOS ecosystem. After mastering secure packaging and performance optimization, applications can simultaneously have the efficiency of C and the flexibility of JS.In the on-board project, this solution reduces the Crash rate of hybrid code by 72%, and controls the performance loss within 5%.Remember: the core of cross-language interaction is "boundary management". If you do a good job in type conversion and resource release, you can give full play to the greatest advantages of each language.
