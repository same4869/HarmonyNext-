# HarmonyOS Next mut function deep practice: variable operations and limitations of value types

In HarmonyOS Next development, the mut function is a key mechanism to break through the immutability of struct value types.As a special instance member function, it allows modifying member variables in value type instances, but also introduces strict scope and access restrictions.This article combines the document "0010 Creating a struct Example - Structure Type - Cangjie Programming Language Development Guide - Learning Cangjie Language.docx" to analyze the core rules and practical scenarios of the `mut` function.


## 1. Syntax rules and scope restrictions of mut function

### 1.1 Syntax identification and basic usage
Functions that allow modification of instance members are performed by the mut keyword, and `this` has special write permissions in the mut` function.

**Basic Example**
```typescript  
struct Counter {  
  var count: Int64 = 0  
  public mut func increment() {  
count += 1 // Legally modify the instance member
  }  
}  
var counter = Counter()  
counter.increment() // Call the mut function, count becomes 1
```  

### 1.2 Prohibit `this` and member variables
Inside the mut function, it is prohibited to capture `this` or instance member variables through closures or nested functions to avoid state inconsistencies caused by escape.

**Error scenario**
```typescript  
struct Foo {  
  var x: Int64 = 0  
  public mut func f() {  
let closure = { => this.x = 1 } // Error: This is not captured
    let nestedFunc = {  
x += 1 // Error: Prevents capture of instance member variables
    }  
  }  
}  
```  

### 1.3 Intermodulation restrictions with ordinary member functions
Non-mut functions prohibit the call to the mut function, otherwise they are allowed to ensure the controllability of mutability operations.

**Permission Control Example**
```typescript  
struct Bar {  
public mut func mutFunc() { nonMutFunc() } // Legal: mut function calls nonmut functions
public func nonMutFunc() { /* mutFunc() // Error: Non-mut functions prohibit calling mut functions */ }
}  
```  


## 2. Applicable scenarios and limitations of mut function

### 2.1 In-situ modification of structure instances
In scenarios where the state of the `struct` instance needs to be modified, the `mut` function is the only legal way (except for instances declared by `let`).

**Typical application: coordinate transformation**
```typescript  
struct Point {  
  var x: Int64, y: Int64  
  public mut func move(dx: Int64, dy: Int64) {  
    x += dx  
y += dy // directly modify the instance coordinates
  }  
}  
var p = Point(x: 10, y: 20)  
p.move(dx: 5, dy: -3) // After calling the mut function, the coordinate becomes (15, 17)
```  

### 2.2 Implementation of mut function in interface
When `struct` implements the mut` function of the interface, the mut` modifier must be maintained; when `class` is implemented, there is no need to modify (the reference type is naturally mutable).

**Interface adaptation example**
```typescript  
interface Mutable {  
  mut func update(value: Int64)  
}  
struct MutStruct : Mutable {  
public mut func update(value: Int64) { /*...*/ } // struct must be added mut
}  
class MutClass : Mutable {  
public func update(value: Int64) { /*...*/ } // class does not require mut
}  
```  

### 2.3 `let` declares the call limit of an instance
The `struct` instance declared using `let` prohibits calling the `mut` function, and an error is reported directly during the compilation period.

**Error case**
```typescript  
let fixedCounter = Counter()  
// fixedCounter.increment() // Error: The mut function cannot be called in the instance declared by let
```  


## 3. Performance impact and optimization of mut function

### 3.1 Cooperation between value type copy and mut function
When calling the mut function, if the struct instance is copied multiple times, it should be noted that each modification only applies to the current copy.

**Status isolation case**
```typescript  
struct State {  
  var flag: Bool = false  
  public mut func toggle() { flag = !flag }  
}  
var s1 = State()  
var s2 = s1 // Copy the instance
s1.toggle() // s1.flag becomes true, s2.flag is still false
```  

### 3.2 Avoid excessive use of mut functions
State changes are preferred by returning the immutable design of a new instance, using only the mut function when necessary, maintaining code traceability.

**Recommended vs Counterexample**
| **Immut Design (Recommended)** | **mut Function Design (Counterexample)** |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| `func move(dx: Int64, dy: Int64) -> Point { return Point(x: x+dx, y: y+dy) }` | `public mut func move(dx: Int64, dy: Int64) { x+=dx; y+=dy }` |  

### 3.3 Optimization of mut function during compilation period
The compiler will strictly check the call of the mut function to ensure that the modification operation conforms to the copy semantics of the value type and avoid runtime exceptions.


## 4. Common Errors and Solutions

### 4.1 Escape issues caused by closure capture
If the closure in the mut` function tries to capture `this` or member variable, it will trigger a compile-time error and need to be replaced by parameter passing.

**Solution: Pass parameters instead of capturing**
```typescript  
struct Counter {  
  var count: Int64 = 0  
  public mut func incrementAndLog() {  
    let oldValue = count  
    count += 1  
log("Incremented from \(oldValue) to \(count)") // Avoid catching count
  }  
}  
```  

### 4.2 The failure problem of cross-interface call mut function
When the `struct` instance is assigned to the interface type, the modification of the `mut` function does not affect the original instance (caused by the copy of the value type).

**Case Analysis**
```typescript  
interface I { mut func f() }  
struct S : I {  
  public var v: Int64 = 0  
  public mut func f() { v += 1 }  
}  
var s = S()  
var i: I = s // Value type copy, i holds a copy of s
i.f() // Modify the v value of the copy
print(s.v) // Output: 0 (the original instance has not been changed)
```  

### 4.3 Errors caused by immutable member variables
If the member variable is declared `let`, it cannot be modified even in the `mut` function. Make sure that the member variable is `var`.

**Cause of error**
```typescript  
struct ImmutableMember {  
let value: Int64 // Immutable member declared by let
  public mut func update(value: Int64) {  
// this.value = value // Error: Cannot modify let member
  }  
}  
```  


## 5. Best practices for mut functions in architectural design

### 5.1 State changes of finite state machines (FSMs)
Use the `mut` function to implement state migration of the value type state machine to ensure the atomicity of each change.

```typescript  
enum ConnectionState { Idle, Connecting, Connected, Disconnected }  
struct Connection {  
  var state: ConnectionState = .Idle  
  public mut func connect() {  
    switch state {  
    case .Idle: state = .Connecting /*...*/  
// Other state migration logic
    }  
  }  
}  
```  

### 5.2 Dynamic operation of buffers
In scenarios where data needs to be frequently modified (such as network reception buffer), use the mut function to achieve efficient in-situ operation.

```typescript  
struct Buffer {  
  var data: [UInt8]  
  public mut func append(data: [UInt8]) {  
self.data += data // Append data in place
  }  
  public mut func clear() {  
self.data.removeAll() // Clear the buffer
  }  
}  
```  

### 5.3 Combination with functional programming
In functional style, local mutable state is realized through the `mut` function to avoid global variable pollution.

```typescript  
func processData(data: inout MyStruct) {  
data.mutFunc() // Pass mutable instance through inout parameter
}  
var instance = MyStruct()  
processData(data: &instance) // Functional processing allowed for modification
```  


## Conclusion
The mut function is a key mechanism for balancing the immutability and operational flexibility of `struct` value type in HarmonyOS Next.Remember when using:
1. **The minimum mutability principle**: Use the `mut` function only when necessary, and implement logic through immutable design first;
2. **Scope control**: Avoid the spread of side effects of the `mut` function, and ensure that modifications only act on the current instance copy;
3. **Interface consistency**: When using across types (such as interface), pay attention to the state isolation problems caused by value type replication.

By rationally using the mut function, developers can achieve safe and controllable variable operations in Hongmeng applications, especially in real-time data processing, finite state management and other scenarios, giving full play to the efficiency and reliability of value types.
