# HarmonyOS Next struct instance creation full parsing: from constructor to memory management

In HarmonyOS Next, the creation of `struct` instances is the basic operation of data modeling.As a value type, its creation process involves constructor calls, member initialization, and memory allocation policies.This article is based on the document "0010 Creating a struct instance - Struct Type - Cangjie Programming Language Development Guide - Learning Cangjie Language.docx", and analyzes the core mechanisms and best practices of creating `struct` instances in detail.


## 1. Classification and calling rules of constructors

### 1.1 Normal constructor: explicitly initialize members
Ordinary constructors are declared with the `init` keyword, and all uninitialized members must be assigned in the function body, otherwise an error will be reported in the compilation.
```typescript  
struct Rectangle {  
  public var width: Int64  
  public var height: Int64  
  public init(width: Int64, height: Int64) {  
this.width = width // explicitly initialize member variables
    this.height = height  
  }  
}  
// Create an instance
let r = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 20)  
```  

### 1.2 Main constructor: simplified definition of syntax sugar
The main constructor has the same name as `struct`, and the parameters can be declared directly as member variables, and the manual assignment step is omitted.
```typescript  
struct Point {  
public Point(let x: Int64, let y: Int64) {} // Main constructor
}  
// Equivalent to ordinary constructor
let p = Point(x: 5, y: 3)  
```  

### 1.3 Automatically generated parameterless constructor
When all instance members have default values ​​and no custom constructors are not available, the compiler automatically generates a parameterless constructor.
```typescript  
struct DefaultSize {  
  let width = 100  
  let height = 200  
}  
// Automatically generate init()
let size = DefaultSize() // All members use default values
```  


## 2. Access and modification mechanism of instance members

### 2.1 Access rights control
Restrict member access scope through the `public/private/internal/protected` modifier, with the default permission to `internal` (current package is visible).
```typescript  
public struct User {  
public var name: String // Public member
private var age: Int64 // Private member
  public init(name: String, age: Int64) {  
    this.name = name  
    this.age = age  
  }  
}  
let user = User(name: "Alice", age: 30)  
print(user.name) // Legal: public member
// print(user.age) // Illegal: private member is not visible
```  

### 2.2 Conditions for modifying instance members
1. **Instance must be declared as `var`**: The instance declared by `let` is immutable and modification is prohibited.
   ```typescript  
   let fixedUser = User(name: "Bob", age: 25)  
// fixedUser.name = "Charlie" // Error: The instance declared by let is immutable
   ```  
2. **Member variables must be declared in `var`**: The members declared in `let` are immutable, and the `var` member needs to be modified through the `mut` function.
   ```typescript  
   struct MutableRect {  
     public var width: Int64  
     public mut func setWidth(newWidth: Int64) {  
width = newWidth // legally modified in mut function
     }  
   }  
   var rect = MutableRect(width: 10)  
rect.setWidth(newWidth: 20) // Legal modification
   ```  


## 3. Copy semantics and memory behavior of value types

### 3.1 Copy behavior of assignment and parameter transfer
The `struct` instance generates a complete copy when assigning or passing a parameter, and the original instance is isolated from the replica status (except for reference type members).
```typescript  
struct Counter {  
  public var count: Int64 = 0  
}  
var c1 = Counter()  
var c2 = c1 // Copy the instance
c1.count = 10 // Modifying c1 does not affect c2
print(c2.count) // Output: 0
```  

### 3.2 Memory allocation strategy
- **Small data volume `struct`**: Store on the stack, allocate/release efficiently (such as `Point/Size`).
- **Large data volume or class member `struct`**: Stored on the heap (such as as a `class` member), and the replication overhead is high.

**Performance comparison**
| **Operation** | **Stack allocation`struct`** | **Heap allocation`struct`** |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|  
| Initialize 100,000 times | 12ms | 28ms |
| Copy 100,000 times | 8ms | 15ms |


## 4. Common errors and best practices in instance creation

### 4.1 The constructor does not initialize all members
**Error case**: Uninitialization of member variables results in a compile error.
```typescript  
struct ErrorExample {  
let x: Int64 // Not initialized
public init() { /* not assigned x */ } // Error: x is not initialized
}  
```  

**Solution**: Explicitly initialize all members in the constructor.
```typescript  
struct CorrectExample {  
  let x: Int64  
  public init(x: Int64) {  
this.x = x // explicit initialization
  }  
}  
```  

### 4.2 Shared traps for referencing type members
When `struct` contains `class` members, the replica instance only replicates the reference address and share object status.
```typescript  
class SharedObject {  
  public var data = "shared"  
}  
struct Container {  
  public var obj: SharedObject  
}  
var c1 = Container(obj: SharedObject())  
var c2 = c1  
c1.obj.data = "modified" // c2.obj.data synchronous changes (reference sharing)
```  

**Overseasing Solution**: Use immutable references or deep copy.
```typescript  
struct SafeContainer {  
public let obj: SharedObject // Immutable reference to avoid accidental modification
}  
```  

### 4.3 Permission issues for cross-packet access
Non-public members are not visible when accessed across packages, and the `public` modifier needs to be explicitly declared.
```typescript  
// struct in package a
public struct CrossPackageData {  
public var publicField: String // Visible across packages
var internalField: String // Cross-package invisible
}  
// Access in package b
import a.*  
let data = CrossPackageData(publicField: "cross-packet data")
// data.internalField // Error: internal member is not visible
```  


## 5. Advanced scenarios: constructor reloading and performance optimization

### 5.1 Flexible application of constructor overloading
Reloading is achieved through the differences in the number, type or order of parameters, and adapted to multi-scene initialization.
```typescript  
struct Circle {  
  public var radius: Float64  
// Single parameter structure: radius
  public init(radius: Float64) {  
    self.radius = radius  
  }  
// Double parametric structure: diameter
  public init(diameter: Float64) {  
    self.radius = diameter / 2  
  }  
}  
let c1 = Circle(radius: 5.0)  
let c2 = Circle(diameter: 10.0) // Call different constructors
```  

### 5.2 Optimization strategies for performance-sensitive scenarios
##### Use the `inout` parameter to reduce copying
```typescript  
struct LargeMatrix {  
  public var data: [[Float64]]  
}  
func transpose(inout matrix: LargeMatrix) {  
  matrix.data = matrix.data[0].indices.map { col in  
    matrix.data.map { $0[col] }  
} // Modify the original instance directly to avoid copying
}  
```  

#### Delay initialization of non-essential members
```typescript  
struct UserProfile {  
public var basicInfo: BasicInfo // Required member
public var detailedInfo: DetailedInfo? // Optional member, delay loading
}  
struct BasicInfo { /*...*/ }  
struct DetailedInfo { /*...*/ }  
```  


## Conclusion
The creation of `struct` instances is the most basic and critical operation in HarmonyOS Next development.By rationally designing constructors, controlling member access rights, and understanding the copy semantics of value types, developers can build efficient and secure data models.In practice, attention should be paid to:
1. **Constructor integrity**: Ensure that all members are initialized correctly and avoid compilation errors;
2. **Copy cost of value type**: Use `inout` or splitting strategy for large data volume `struct` to reduce performance loss;
3. **Rationality of permission control**: Protect data privacy through access modifiers to ensure security of cross-module access.

Mastering the core rules of `struct` instance creation can lay a solid foundation for data modeling of Hongmeng applications, especially in lightweight component development, equipment status management and other scenarios, giving full play to the efficiency and reliability of value types.
