# HarmonyOS Next String Art: From Interpolation to Regular Match
In HarmonyOS Next development, string processing is an extremely common and important task.Cangjie Language provides rich string processing functions, from diverse literal forms to powerful Unicode support, to flexible pattern matching capabilities, providing developers with many conveniences.As a technical expert with many years of practical experience in this field, I will introduce the key technical points of string processing in detail below.

## Chapter 1: A complete set of literals
The string literals in Cangjie language include three types: single-line string literals, multi-line string literals, and multi-line original string literals. Their escape rules have their own characteristics, as shown in the following table:
|Literal type|Definition method|Escape rules|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Single-line string literals|Parse content with a pair of single or double quotes|Contains any character except for the non-escaped quotes that define the string and the separate `\`; `\` is used to escape special characters|`let s1 = 'Hello Cangjie Lang'; let s2 = "He said, \"Hello!\""`|
|Multiline string literals|Package content with three double quotes `"""` or three single quotes `''', the content starts from the first line after a newline and ends with the first non-escaped three quotes|can contain any character except the separate `\`; `\` is used to escape special characters|`let s1 = """This is a\nmultiline string."""; let s2 = '''Another\nmultiline string.'''`|
|Multi-line raw string literal|Open with one or more `#` and a single or double quote until the same quotation mark and the same number of `#` end|escape characters are not escaped, and the literal content is rendered as is|`let s1 = #""#; let s2 = ##'\n'##; let s3 = ###"This is a\nraw multiline string.\n"###`|

In actual development, the appropriate string literal should be selected according to the specific needs.For example, when you need to define a simple single-line text, the single-line string literal is the most convenient; and when dealing with scenes containing multi-line text, such as SQL statements and HTML fragments, the multi-line string literal is more appropriate; if you want to keep the string content as it is and avoid interference from escaped characters, the multi-line original string literal is the best choice.

## Chapter 2: Unicode processing
In the context of globalization, it is becoming increasingly important to process strings containing characters from multiple languages.The string type of Cangjie language provides good support for Unicode.Taking the UTF-8-byte traversal of Chinese and English mixed strings as an example:
```cj
let mixedString = "Hello, Hello!"
for (byte in mixedString.utf8) {
    print(byte)
    print(" ")
}
```
In this code, the UTF-8 encoded byte sequence of the string can be obtained through the `utf8` property, and then loop through each byte using the `for-in`.This is very useful in handling scenarios where byte-level operations on strings are required, such as network transmission, encryption algorithms, etc.During the traversal process, specific processing can be performed based on the byte value, such as encrypting or converting certain special bytes.At the same time, this support for Unicode also ensures the correctness and consistency of string operations when processing text in different languages.

## Chapter 3: Pattern Matching
Pattern matching is a powerful function in string processing. Cangjie Language implements flexible string pattern matching through regular expressions.Take using regular extraction XML tags as an example:
```cj
import std.regex.*

let xml = "<root><element>Value</element></root>"
let regex = Regex("<([a - z]+)>(.*?)</\\1>")
let matches = regex.findAll(xml)
for (match in matches) {
    let tagName = match.group(1)
    let tagValue = match.group(2)
    println("Tag Name: \(tagName), Tag Value: \(tagValue)")
}
```
In the above code, a regular expression `<([a - z]+)>(.*?)</\1>` is defined, which can match XML tags and their contents.`([a - z]+)` is used to capture the label name, `(.*?)` is used to capture the content inside the label, and `</\1>` is used to match the end tag, where `\1` represents the content that references the first capture group.Through the `findAll` method of the `Regex` class, you can find all matching tags in the XML string and get the content of the capture group through the `group` method.This pattern matching method based on regular expression plays an important role in handling XML, HTML parsing, log analysis and other scenarios, and can quickly and accurately extract the required information.

Mastering the use of string literals, Unicode processing techniques, and pattern matching applications can help developers efficiently handle various string-related tasks in HarmonyOS Next development.Whether it is building international applications or conducting complex text parsing, these technologies will provide strong support for development work.
